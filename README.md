# Chinese Remainder Theorem
This code implements the Chinese Remainder Theorem 

The use of function can be seen in the example file

The equations can be of form:

x ≡ 1 (mod 5) , 
x ≡ 2 (mod 7) ,
x ≡ 3 (mod 9) ,
x ≡ 4 (mod 11) ,

The array a = [1 2 3 4] ,
the array m = [5 7 9 11] ,
value of  n = 4 .
